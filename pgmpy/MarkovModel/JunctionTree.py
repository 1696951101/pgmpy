class JunctionTree(UndirectedGraph):
    """
    This class is meant to represent junction trees (Called as clique trees popularly).
    It will contain a lot of functionalities to work on junction trees and to run
    inference algorithms on JunctionTrees,

        This adds appropriate edges to the junction tree graph. Given a junction tree
        with all the nodes containing cliques of the MarkovModel, running the function
        on the junction tree will add all edges to the JT and then remove edges as
        necessary to make it a Junction Tree (is a tree and satisfies Running Intersection
        Property)
